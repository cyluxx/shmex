## Motivation

Why do we need another music scoring app?

1. I like it simple. Unfortunetaly, Music notation is complicated. I want to concentrate on the basics of band sheet music.
2. I am a programmer. The concept of describing music with a domain specific language is worth a try. Even after 100+ Sheets, I find WYSIWYG quite tedious.
3. I write music. The most fun programming projects are the ones, you are passionate about. Maybe I'll never finish this app. But at least, I had fun :).

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).
